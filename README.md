ProjectEval - Front End
=====================================

ProjectEval is a new take on code learning sites.  Users can learn a new language/framework, or just sharpen their skills, by completing sets of coding challenges that actually add up to a working application.  Once a project's set of challenges are complete, the user can push the app to their GitHub page with a click of a button.  BOOM.
