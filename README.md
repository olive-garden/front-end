ProjectEval - Front End
=====================================

##Don't Just Learn. Create!
ProjectEval is an engaging new way to learn coding.  Complete a series of fun coding challenges that leave you with an actual working application.  After that, you can see other coders’ solutions and see how they did it!

Nervous? Don’t be. This should be fun!  We encourage you to share your solutions with the community, but if you’ve got cold feet, we let you hide your solutions.
