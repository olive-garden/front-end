<h1>Don't Just Learn. Create!</h1>
<p>ProjectEval is an engaging new way to learn coding.  Complete a series of fun coding challenges that leave you with an actual working application.  After that, you can see other coders’ solutions and see how they did it!</p>

<p>Nervous? Don’t be. This should be fun!  We encourage you to share your solutions with the community, but if you’ve got cold feet, we let you hide your solutions.</p>
